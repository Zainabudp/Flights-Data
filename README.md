Plane Finder: A Real-Time Flight Tracking Script
This Python project retrieves real-time flight data using the OpenSky Network API, processing aircraft details such as flight names, origins, and locations. The data is displayed on an interactive map using Folium, allowing users to visualize flights over a specific region. Additional analysis includes flight frequency by origin country, represented in bar charts with Seaborn and Matplotlib. This tool provides a dynamic way to track airborne flights and analyze aviation patterns.

How to run the code
- If the script contains a Colab link, simply click on it or copy-paste the URL into your browser.
- This will open the notebook in Google Colab, an interactive cloud-based environment.
